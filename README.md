# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

![Sorting Algorithm Visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Simret101/Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer/main/assets/photo_2025-01-27_14-53-43.jpg)

This project is a visualization tool for understanding and demonstrating sorting algorithms. Built with Python and Pygame, the visualization dynamically displays the sorting process in real-time, providing an interactive way to learn sorting techniques.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms Supported:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- **Modes of Sorting:**
  - Ascending
  - Descending

- **Keyboard Controls:**
  - `R`: Reset the array
  - `SPACE`: Start Sorting
  - `A`: Set sorting mode to Ascending
  - `D`: Set sorting mode to Descending
  - `I`: Select Insertion Sort
  - `B`: Select Bubble Sort
